# Î³Ticker v1.11 by Alexander Ralston
# Last Revised on 12//2020
# Fetch and display data from APIs.
# All icons are from https://freeicons.io/

# To do:
# Truncation global option on/off and character length.
# Global preferences time in am/pm
# Update scrollbar with added items rather than resizing window
# Close to task bar.
# TickerPrefrences.save() calls window.foreground() unnecessarily.
# Display entire api_dict, but formatted, through right-click menu.

# Alarms:
# Alarm window redo
# Email -- keyring?
# Alarm icon within row to indicate if an alarm is enabled.
# Alarms can handle strings

# Style:
# Redo icon
# Arrow sizes/colors
# Save window position?
